# Uploads the public key, the private key, and the revocation certificate
# (when one exists) as attachments of a vault item, replacing the previous
# copies so the item holds exactly one current backup of each. The private-key
# export keeps the key's passphrase protection - it is not readable without
# the passphrase, and the vault adds its own encryption on top.
#
# rwr exposes the key's passphrase as RWR_CRED_GPG_PASSPHRASE (see init.yaml).
# When set, the script proves the exported key actually unlocks with it before
# anything is uploaded, so a drifted passphrase is caught on backup day, not
# restore day.
